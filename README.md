# Looped Headless Content Management System

[![API](https://github.com/looped-dev/cms/actions/workflows/api.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/looped-dev/cms/actions/workflows/api.yml)

> Early Work in Progress (Please comeback later)

Looped Headless CMS is a modern, lightweight, and opinionated headless CMS for
managing blogs, publications, and journals. This CMS is inspired by the Ghost
CMS but focuses on being a headless CMS only to enable you to build custom and
rich user
experiences for your readers and users. At the same time, we handle the
nitty-gritty stuff like Content Management, Member Subscriptions, Payments, and
so on.

As a headless content management system (CMS), you bring your frontend, which
you can build using Frameworks like Angular, React, Vue, Vanilla JS, or static
site generators like Hugo, Jekyll, etc.

This is still a work in progress; for the initial version, I am targetting the
following features:

- Content Management - Pages, Posts, Tags, etc.
- An Admin UI for managing content
- GraphQL API for connecting your frontend to the headless CMS
- Membership and Membership Subscription feature - allowing you to control access to content by members.
- Staff Management - Be able to give access to your staff to access the Admin UI and manage content with granular access control
